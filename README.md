# Simple-OpenGl-Wrapper
This library simplifies the opengl program development process by allow users easily access and manipulate OpenGL objects through class wrappers.


# Disclaimer
I am still in the opengl learning process, so expect stuff to not work if you are feeling risky and want to use this.
